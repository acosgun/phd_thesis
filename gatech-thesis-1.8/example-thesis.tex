\chapter{Navigation Among People}
\label{chapter:navigation_among_people}

Autonomous navigation is one of the most fundamental tasks for a mobile robot. For a mobile robot with adequate actuation and sensing, collision-free navigation is considered a solved problem. There are many algorithms that achieve point-to-point autonomous navigation thanks to the advances in the motion planning community. Many of these algorithms are optimized to find the least-cost path, or the shortest path. However, when there are humans in the environment, such algorithms suddenly become inefficient or insufficient. For example, while it is acceptable for a robot to get inches close to a wall, doing so to a human is socially unacceptable and potentially dangerous. Similarly, sudden appearance of a robot can surprise or shock humans. There are many other social scenarios where the shortest path may not be optimal. 

In addition to sub-optimality, these approaches may be incomplete in the sense that they can not find a solution even though there is a feasible one. This is because shortest-path navigation algorithms treat every object in the environment as an obstacle. This assumption does not hold when intelligent agents are present in the environment. Therefore navigation should differentiate humans and obstacles for more intelligent robot behavior.

Another aspect to spatial interaction between humans and robots is the dynamics of the robot motion. For example, people may feel uncomfortable and unsafe when they are in close proximity to high-speed agents or objects. Therefore, for a robot in a human environment, while it may be acceptable to speed up in dedicated regions, its speed should be limited in places where there is a significant possibility of encountering a human.

In this Chapter, we first provide a background and present the most common approach in contemporary autonomous navigation methods in Section \ref{sec:navigation_contemporary_navigation_practices}. Second, we provide provide relevant works on navigation among people in Section \ref{sec:navigation_related_work}. Third, in Section \ref{sec:navigation_finding_goal_points_for_navigation}, we present how the goal points for navigation are determined. We then present our people-aware navigation method in Section \ref{sec:navigation_people_aware_navigation}. Lastly, we touch to the subject of introducing speed limits for all robots in a human environment in Section \ref{sec:navigation_speed_limits}.


\section{State-of-the-Art Approach in Autonomous Navigation}
\label{sec:navigation_contemporary_navigation_practices}

There are two prerequisites that enables autonomous navigation: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The map of the environment, usually in the form of a discrete grid, that represents static objects in the environment
\item A way to localize the robot in the map using sensory information as it moves in the environment
\end{enumerate}

Robot navigation involves finding a collision-free path from a start pose $(x_{0},y_{0},\theta_0)$ to a goal pose $(x_{g},y_{g},\theta_g)$. In real-time operation, $(x_{0},y_{0}, \theta_0)$ is the robot's current pose as the robot tries to reach to the goal pose from where it currently is. $\theta_g$ is optional as the goal of the robot could be to reach the goal position regardless of its orientation. The goal position is provided from an external process, and we will touch upon how the goal positions are calculated in Section \ref{sec:navigation_finding_goal_points_for_navigation}.

\label{fig:navigation_overview}
\end{figure}

A common approach to path planning is to divide the path planning into two parts: $global$ and $local$. Global planning aims to find a path from the start position to the goal position. The global path is a set of consecutive positions that connect the start to goal position. A global path is usually found with a search algorithm executed on a graph of points. The search heuristics is dependent on specific global planners, and in most cases collision-free shorter paths are favored. The local planner is responsible to execute the global path by calculating a trajectory and sending velocity commands to motor controllers. As the robot acts in the environment, its sensors sense the new state of the robot and people, and the new iteration begins. This cycle is shown in Figure \ref{fig:navigation_overview}. 

A popular method to to implement the global and local planners is by using a $costmap$ . A $costmap$ not only has the same representation as the map, however collision-free positions can have non-zero costs. A lower cost cell is more favored to be in to a higher cost cell. After the calculation of all cells, the least-cost path is found that connects the start position to the goal position.

Note that this approach assumes the robot is able to execute any path provided to it. Holonomic robots can move in any direction, however non-holonomic robots has limitations in their movements. For example, two wheel robots can not move sideways. Two common approaches to solve this problem are: to implement trajectory planners that can handle imperfect control or to embed the robot's dynamics into sampling for global and local planning.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:navigation_related_work}

In this section, we review the literature on robot navigation in human environments including socially acceptable navigation, learning behaviors from humans and cooperative navigation.

\subsection{Socially Acceptable Path Planning}
Socially acceptable robot navigation is considered in different applications such as free navigation~\cite{sisbot2007human}, approaching people~\cite{satake2009approach} and evacuating buildings~\cite{ohki2010collision}. Some works used the personal space concept in cost-based general path planners~\cite{sisbot2007human,kirby2009companion}. Sisbot~\cite{sisbot2007human} models the social spaces as a ellipse-shaped Gaussian, and takes into account the safety, preferences and vision fields of humans for a robot that navigates from a location to another. Kirby~\cite{kirby2009companion} presents a path planner that takes into account social conventions such as tending to one side of the hallways. A potential field based trajectory planner for dynamic human environments is presented by Svenstrup~\cite{svenstrup2010trajectory}. Rios-Martinez~\cite{rios2011understanding} presents a RRT-based planner that considers not just safety but also the disturbance of humans. In simulation, if interaction within a group of people is detected, the robot can either not disturb the interaction or join the group. This approach is implemented on a wheelchair robot~\cite{vasquez2012human}. Althaus~\cite{althaus2004navigation} presents a robot that can join a group of people and adjust to the formation reactively. The scenario where a robot encounters a human in a hallway is studied by Pacchierotti ~\cite{pacchierotti2005human}. Parameters such as the distance between the human and the robot when the robot begins to deviate from its path and lateral distance that robot should be placed when it is passing the human are found from experiments. Recent work by Lu~\cite{lu2013towards} showed that using gaze cues and social navigation makes robot-human hallway passing more efficient.

\subsection{Learning Navigation from Human Behavior}

Behaving human-like in robot navigation is usually favored in the literature~\cite{sasaki2006human}. One way to simulate human navigation behavior is to use social cost maps that capture social conventions \cite{scandolo2011anthropomorphic,luber2012socially}. Contrary to the imitation approach, \cite{bennewitz2005learning} tries to avoid predicted paths, with the goal to minimize the risk of interference. Kuderer~\cite{kuderer2013teaching} presents a tele-operated robot that computes the policy of a desired interactive navigation by learning from observations of pedestrians. Pellegrini~\cite{pellegrini2009you} trains a dynamic social behavior, that account for social interactions, using pedestrian data.

\subsection{Human Cooperation in Robot Navigation}

Robots can exploit human cooperation in certain scenarios. In populated environments, one way to move with the crowd is to follow individuals that move towards the robot's goal~\cite{stein2012robot,muller2008socially}. 

Some of the recent works in the literature claim that the robot motions should be predictable so the human observers can judge the motive and future behavior of the robot. Observational study in~\cite{lichtenthaler2013towards} claims that three features can increase the predictability of robot navigation: straight lines, stereotypical motions and usage of additional gestures. In a user study conducted by Gockley~\cite{gockley2007natural}, humans observers watched two ways of person following. People found direction-following more natural than exact path following. Kruse~\cite{kruse2012legible} observes that when paths of two humans are crossed at a right angle, they adapt their velocity rather than the path. This behavior is implemented on a robot, resulting in more predictable motions. 

Trautman~\cite{trautman2010unfreezing} introduces the 'freezing problem', where traditional path planners fail to produce a feasible solution in crowded human environments. Muller~\cite{muller2008socially} briefly mentions a 'shooing away' behavior, where the robot accelerates towards a human, hoping that he/she will get out of the way. Kruse~\cite{kruse2010exploiting} introduces an optimistic planner, which assumes that people will cooperate with robot movements. Their approach relies on assigning a non-infinite cost if a robot enters to a human's personal space, however the plan fails if humans doesn't move as expected because of the lack a local planner.
