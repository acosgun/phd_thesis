\section{Background}

\subsection{Social Spaces}



\section{Thesis Overview}
\subsection{Thesis Statement}

Non-expert users can label objects, landmarks and locations while giving a tour to a mobile robot, where the labeled entities enable situational awareness and serve as end goals, which robots can navigate to, by taking into account the personal spaces of nearby humans and social factors.


\subsection{Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Development of a multimodal person detection and tracking system.
\item A method for a human to take a mobile robot on a tour and interactively add labeled objects, landmarks and locations to the robot's map using natural deictic gestures and later use the labeled entities as end goals for navigation.
\item Development of a navigation planner that takes into account social factors, and reactions of people to robot's motions.
\item Development of a person guidance behavior and further investigation on the usage for blind users.
\item Development of a person following behavior and further investigation on the usage for telepresence robots.
\item Demonstration of situational awareness for person following behavior, targeted at the tour scenario.
\end{itemize}

%\textbf{Chapter - Map Annotation}





%According to Lam~\cite{lam2011human}, mobile robots should obey certain rules while navigating in human environments. These rules include: not colliding anybody, not entering the personal space of a human unless the task is to approach the human and waiting if robot unwillingly enters the personal space of a human. Humans are already good at obeying such social conventions. Therefore most works on robot navigation in human environments is linked to human-human spatial interactions. One of the first studies in such interactions is conducted by Hall~\cite{hall1969hidden}. This study presents the proxemics theory, which categorizes the distance between people in four classes. These distances, named intimate, personal, social and public, provide spatial limits to different types of interactions. Kendon~\cite{kendon1990conducting}'s F-formation is based upon observations that people often group themselves in a spatial formation, e.g. in clusters, lines and circles. Some works adopted Hall distances and Kendon's formations for human-robot interaction. Huttenrauch~\cite{huttenrauch2006investigating} found that personal distance between a robot and a person varied in the range of 0.45 to 1.2 meters and but claimed that works of Hall and Kendon should be adapted to suit the dynamics of HRI. Avrunin~\cite{avrunin2013using} aims to learn acceptable distances from human-human experiments in an approaching scenario.

%There are several areas of related research. The most
%closely related approach to our own is that of Human
%Augmented Mapping (HAM), introduced by Topp and Christensen
%in [23] and [22]. The Human Augmented Mapping
%approach is to have a human assist the robot in the mapping
%process, and add semantic information to the map. The
%proposed scenario is to have a human guide a robot on a tour
%of an indoor environment, adding relevant labels to the map
%throughout the tour. The HAM approach involves labeling
%two types of entities: regions, and locations. Regions are
%meant to represent areas such as rooms or hallways, and
%serve as containers for locations. Locations are meant to
%represent specific important places in the environment, such
%as a position at which a robot should perform a task. This
%approach was applied to the Cosy Explorer system, described
%in [27], which includes a semantic mapping system that
%multi-layered maps, including a metric feature based map, a
%topological map, as well as detected objects. While the goal
%of our approach is similar, we use a significantly different
%map representation, method of labeling, and interaction.
