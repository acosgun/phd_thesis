	robot-human interactions will need to reach a level of fluency
	
	close to that of human-human interactions. In this paper we
	
	address the fluency of robot-human hand-overs. From an ob-
	
	servational study with our robot HERB, we identify the key
	
	problems with a baseline hand-over action. We nd that
	
	the failure to convey the intention of handing over causes
	
	delays in the transfer, while the lack of an intuitive signal to
	
	indicate timing of the hand-over causes early, unsuccessful
	
	attempts to take the object. We propose to address these
	
	problems with the use of spatial contrast, in the form of dis-
	
	tinct hand-over poses, and temporal contrast, in the form of
	
	unambiguous transitions to the hand-over pose. We conduct
	
	a survey to identify distinct hand-over poses, and determine
	
	variables of the pose that have most communicative poten-
	
	tial for the intent of handing over. We present an experiment
	
	that analyzes the eect of the two types of contrast on the
	
	fluency of hand-overs. We nd that temporal contrast is
	
	particularly useful in improving fluency by eliminating early
	
	attempts of the human.},
